Today I'm reflecting on the process of learning Linux. 
At first, my understanding of Linux was fairly basic: 
I saw it simply as a different operating system from Windows, 
one that required using a terminal window and command-line navigation. 

I was using it for simple things like creating files and folders.
Or opening and navigating directories. Or even renaming files
and moving them. It was boring stuff that seemed to have no purpose.

For a long time, my perspective was essentially, 
"Okay, I can use a different operating system now but so what?"
Over time, my understanding evolved, especially regarding Kali Linux. 
I came to realize that Kali is much more than just another OS.
Itâ€™s a fully equipped hacking toolbox, packed with a wide range of tools 
designed specifically for cybersecurity work. 

I began practicing using the option nmap -sn {user_IP/CIDR} to reaveal hosts 
on a network, I was just curios. Then nmap -sV for verbose information 
about open ports, a command I 1st started using for hackthebox.com activities. 
The nmap options are just a few examples of powerful tools that have proven 
useful in hacking.

Nmap and other tools support every phase of the hacking process: 
from initial device discovery, information gathering, reconnaissance, 
to enumeration, mapping open ports and services, gaining a foothold on a system, 
and finally, navigating through the system to read and extract information.

As I gained a deeper understanding of Linux, my appreciation for it also grew. 
Learning how tools like nmap communicate with systems to reveal vulnerabilities
opened my eyes to the true capabililties that Kali Linux provides. It has 
changed my perspective of what Linux is used for.

Thanks for reading, and have a nice day!
